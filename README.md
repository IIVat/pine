# MetaWeb
MetaWeb provides Scala bindings for HTML5. The bindings are directly generated from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

This project is still WIP.

## Vision
The goal is to parse HTML code during compile-time and then translate it to an object structure. This will allow us to reduce overhead during runtime.

Furthermore, there will be a possibility of loading external HTML files.
