# MetaWeb
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MetaStack-pl/MetaWeb.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MetaStack-pl/MetaWeb)

MetaWeb provides Scala bindings for HTML5. The bindings are directly generated from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

This project is still WIP.

## Vision
The goal is to parse HTML code during compile-time and then translate it to an object structure. This will allow us to reduce runtime overhead.

HTML can be specified inline or loaded from external files.
